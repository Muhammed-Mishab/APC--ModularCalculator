# APC--ModularCalculator

This project implements a modular calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

# objective

The objective of this APC project is to design and implement a menu-driven calculator application using the C programming language by applying modular programming concepts. The project aims to strengthen understanding of function decomposition, header files, file separation, and input validation while performing basic arithmetic operations efficiently.

# Tools Used
- C Programming Language
- Linux environment
- GCC compiler
